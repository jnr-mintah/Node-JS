            As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is
            designed to build scalable network applications. In the following
            "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently.
            Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work
            to be done, Node.js will sleep. <br>
            <br>
            This is in contrast to today's more
            common concurrency model, in which OS threads are employed.
            Thread-based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult
            to use. Furthermore, users of Node.js are free from worries of
            dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no
            function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never
            blocks except when the I/O is performed using synchronous methods of
            Node.js standard library. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems
            are very reasonable to develop in Node.js. <br><br> If some of this language
            is unfamiliar, there is a full article on <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Blocking vs. Non-Blocking.</span>

            Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like
            Ruby's <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Event Machine</span> and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event
            model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime
            construct instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always
            a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is
            defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the
            end a server is started through a blocking call like
            EventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such
            start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop
            after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when
            there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like
            browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user. <br><br> HTTP is
            a first-class citizen in Node.js, designed with streaming and low
            latency in mind. This makes Node.js well suited for the foundation
            of a web library or framework. <br><br> Node.js being designed without
            threads doesn't mean you can't take advantage of multiple cores in
            your environment. Child processes can be spawned by using our
            child_process.fork() API, and are designed to be easy to communicate
            with. Built upon that same interface is the cluster module, which
            allows you to share sockets between processes to enable load
            balancing over your cores.
